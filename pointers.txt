1. Our data is real city data and hence much more practical and realistic than deepMIMO data
2. Our user heights change with the terrain of the city unlike the deepMIMO data where user height always remains 2m
3. its THz domain and not mmWave
4. Real situation of gas, fog, cloud affecting THz waves are taken into account which were hitherto not that significantly affecting propagation
5. 

To Generate deepMIMO data
1. run raytracer_100GHz.m
2. Copy and paste O1_60.params.mat into O1_60 and rename it to O1_100
3. modify and run inner_param_generator_100GHz.m
4. modify parameters_100GHz, and DeepMIMO_generator as needed for the current situation
5. modify and run DeepMIMODatasetGenerator_100GHz.m 
6. run raytracer_2p4GHz.m
7. Copy and paste O1_2p4.params.mat into O1_2p4 and rename it to O1_2p4
8. modify and run inner_param_generator_2p4GHz.m
9. modify parameters_2p4GHz, and DeepMIMO_generator as needed for the current situation
10. run DeepMIMODatasetGenerator_2p4GHz.m

To run ML
1. Rename deepMIMOdataset files as dataset_100GHz and dataset_2p4GHz
2. Modify and run datastructure_generator.m
3. Modify all parameters appropriately in main.m
4. run main.m
